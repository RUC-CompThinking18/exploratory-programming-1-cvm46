//Dear Professor Dubose, I want you to know that this was one of the most painful experiences
//I have had the displeasure of being part of. Javascript is a hell language made by demons for demons
//I had about as much fun doing this assignment on here then Abramham Lincoln did at the Ford Theatre
//As for your assistance I couldn't come to your office hours because I had to go to the career fair
//I think chopping my balls off and eating them would have been a much more pleasurable experience
//also by the time I was doing this you wouldn't have answered my email in time.
//All I know is that this is both my fault and that I now have an undying hatred for Javascript
function limitBreaker(array){
  //result = array //this is the bane of my existance
  result=[]
  var element=1;
  for (var i=0; i<array.length; i++){//this line will alter the original function so that way it works it multiplies twenty and then the previous element as well
    element = element * array[i]*20;//this multiplies the elements of the result by twenty
    result.push(element)//this puts the elements back into the result
  }
  dumbVariable=result
  console.log(dumbVariable)
  return result //this returns the result
  //I hope whoever made javascript is in Hell as Satan stabs his balls with a pitchfork.
  //by the way I double checked to make sure the inventor of Javascript was a dude
  //if I was wrong then my comment would not have worked.
}
limitBreaker([1,2,3])
x=[1,2,3]
limitBreaker(x)

//fuck javascript. I know this doesn't explain the program but seriously fuck javascript.
//It's my code I'll comment whatever the fuck I want
